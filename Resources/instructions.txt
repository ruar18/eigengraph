Welcome to EigenGraph, a simple and consistent graphing program.
To use it, press start, and choose one of the 4 base functions by pressing their respective buttons.
Then, open the drop-down menu, and select a specific function type by clicking it.
Adjust the a, b, h, k parameters which transform the functions by using the 4 sliders available.
When done, simple press "Add" to plot the function.
Once the function is plotted, you can press the "Integrate" button to visualize the integral of the function 
over its displayed domain. Feel free to change the function at any time and explore the properties of functions.
You can also see the mapping that the function describes on the bottom of the function-selection panel, 
after pressing "Add". Note, EigenGraph is meant for students to explore transformations, not for professional graphing.
Also, try to find the hidden Easter Egg if you can. Hint: play around with the power functions!
(But be careful, this is purely experimental and may be highly unstable.)

Press "Start" to begin.
